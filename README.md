## MoorOthello
Implementation of the game Othello using the MVC move pattern. Has the ability to show possible moves, undo moves, and show who's winning.

## VirtualRealities
Continuation of MoorOthello but with a polymorphic twist. Allows for user to select from Othello, TicTacToe, or Connect Four (hopefully pending checkers) and perform the same actions available in the MoorOthello project.
